  return `Dear ${name},

I’m writing to implore you to pressure President Trump to immediately rescind his 6-month executive order authorizing federal officers to patrol American cities. This use of presidential power to turn federal agents against civilians—who are exercising their constitutional right to peacefully protest—sets a detrimental precedent for the freedom of this democracy. I urge you to work with your colleagues in government to promptly investigate this use of federal law enforcement and work to overturn the president’s executive order.

In the immediate term, you must demand that federal troops leave the streets of Portland, OR. Agents from the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Marshals Service, Federal Protective Service and U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC) have been patrolling Portland since July 2nd. Every night since, federal agents have tear gassed, assaulted, and abducted peaceful protestors.

They are tear gassing mothers, some of whom are pregnant. They are beating veterans. They are sending people to the hospital with life-threatening wounds. They are abducting civilians on the street in unmarked vans.

We cannot allow what’s happening in Portland to be the barometer for federal and military force in this nation. It is your job to protect your constituents, and the Constitution of the United States of America.

Sincerely,

  `
